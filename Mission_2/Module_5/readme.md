## Why We Learn and use Typescript


### 🔥 **Top 5 Reasons to Use TypeScript**

1. 🛡️ **Early Error Detection** – Catches bugs during development, not after running your code.
2. 💡 **Smarter Autocomplete & IntelliSense** – Gives better code suggestions, hints, and documentation in your editor.
3. 🧩 **Improved Code Quality & Maintainability** – Helps keep large projects organized, readable, and consistent.
4. ⚙️ **Easier Refactoring** – Makes changing or updating code safer without breaking existing features.
5. 🚀 **Industry Standard** – Used by major companies (Google, Microsoft, Meta, etc.) and frameworks like React, Angular, and Next.js.
